The python client
---------------

The `api-client-python <https://github.com/googlegenomics/api-client-java>`_ project
provides a simple genome browser that pulls data from the Genomics API.

The api-client-python project does not currently use 
`Google's python client library <https://devsite.googleplex.com/api-client-library/python/>`_. 
If you want to use the client library, the
`method documentation <http://google-api-client-libraries.appspot.com/documentation/genomics/v1beta/python/1.0/index.html>`_ 
for genomics can be very useful.
