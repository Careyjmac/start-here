The python client
---------------

The `api-client-python <https://github.com/googlegenomics/api-client-python>`_ project
provides a simple genome browser that pulls data from the Genomics API.

The python client does not currently use 
`Google's python client library <https://devsite.googleplex.com/api-client-library/python/>`_. 
If you want to use the client library, the
`method documentation <https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/genomics/v1beta2/python/latest/>`_ 
for genomics can be very useful.
