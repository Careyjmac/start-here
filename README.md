* [Try a few queries on public genomic data](https://github.com/googlegenomics/getting-started-bigquery) using Google BigQuery.

#### What You'll Find on GitHub

There are a *ton* of samples on github for a variety of genomics use cases.  You'll find the samples described both by task (e.g., variant annotation) and technology (e.g. R, Python, BigQuery) on the [Google Genomics Cookbook](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

##### Documentation

* See https://cloud.google.com/genomics to understand what Google Genomics is and how to get started.
* See http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org for an incrementally growing task-oriented cookbook.
* See the README in each GitHub repository for specifics about the code.
