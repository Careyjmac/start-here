====

The documentation for all of the repositories in googlegenomics is hosted on readthedocs at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org.

The text on that site is automatically pushed from this repo's 
[reStructuredText](<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files. See [Read The Doc's documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) for more info.

Please help us improve these docs by [contributing](https://github.com/googlegenomics/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)!

For documentation about the Google Genomics APIs themselves, see 
http://developers.google.com/genomics and http://ga4gh.org
