Analyze Variants
=================

There are a collection of analyses upon variants documented in codelab  `Data Analysis using Google Genomics <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis>`_.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See :doc:`../load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Update the BigQuery table name, variant set id, and read group set to match those of your data.
