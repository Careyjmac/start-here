Data Analysis Codelab
=====================

There are a collection of analyses upon variants documented in codelab `Data Analysis using Google Genomics`_.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See :doc:`/use_cases/load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Update the BigQuery table name, variant set id, and read group set in the example to match those of your data.
