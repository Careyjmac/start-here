Annotate Variants with BioConductor
===================================

An example of variant annotation with `BioConductor <http://www.bioconductor.org/>`_ is documented towards the end of codelab  `Data Analysis using Google Genomics <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis/AllModalitiesDemo.md#annotate-variants-with-bioconductor>`_.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics.  See :doc:`../load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Update the variant set id used in the call to ``getVariants`` in `the example <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis/AllModalitiesDemo.md#annotate-variants-with-bioconductor>`_ to match that of your data.
