Annotate Variants with BioConductor
===================================

   :maxdepth: 2

An example of variant annotation with BioConductor is documented towards the end of codelab  `Data Analysis using Google Genomics <https://github.com/googlegenomics/codelabs/tree/master/R/1000Genomes-BRCA1-analysis>`_.

To make use of this upon your own data:

(1) First, load your data into Google Genomics and export your variants to BigQuery.  See :doc:`../load_data/index` for more detail as to how to do this.
(2) Update the variant set id to match that of your data.
