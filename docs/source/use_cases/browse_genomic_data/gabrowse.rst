* Use the button on the left to select a Read group set or Call set.
* Once loaded, choose a chromosome and zoom or drag the main graph to explore Read data.
* Individual bases will appear once you zoom in far enough.

The code for this sample application is on GitHub https://github.com/googlegenomics/api-client-python
