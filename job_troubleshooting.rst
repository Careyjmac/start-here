Troubleshooting Job failures
------------------------------

If you were redirected to this page from a Job failure, that means 
your Job failed for an unknown reason. 

Either the failure was transient (which occassionally happens) and the 
Job should be retried, or there is a bug in our implementation which is 
causing an unexpected exception.

Rest assured that we keep track of all failed Jobs, and will track 
down the bug if there is one. In a perfect world, you would never need 
to see this page. 

Because you are here though, please try the following:

* Re-launch your Job once more.
* If the Job fails a second time, please email google-genomics-discuss@googlegroups.com 
  with both of your Job IDs.
  
Sorry for the failure - we'll do better next time.
